### Overhauls

- Removed SawyerBatty, and all mention of it within the guide. SawyerBatty was replaced by New Blood, Aid Addon and Sweets Consumables for a more consistent and complete overhaul of the games difficulty.
- Removed Cyberware 2281. Cyberware 2281 was removed because of my intent to include EDGE (which I haven't got around to fully patching yet) in the guide. Cyberware 2281 is still fine for use, the mod isn't broken or anything. Just not particularly compatible with EDGE's changing of the implant system.
- Removed CyberJAM
- Removed Save Restrictions, feature creep.
- Added JIP Localized Damage Fix
- Removed Three Perk Bounty, some UI glitches I noticed in testing, and saw some stuff about incompatibility with added perks.
- Added New Blood
- Added Aid Addon
- Added Sweet Consumables

### Visuals

- Changed wording of the notice about Salamand3r's texture guide
- Removed Anniversary Anim General Bugfix, integrated into Anniversary Anim Pack proper.
