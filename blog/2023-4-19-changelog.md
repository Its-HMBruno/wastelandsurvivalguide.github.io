# Changelog - Settle for Less

### 19/04/2024

I know the someguy2000 mods are beloved by many, but not by me and considering most people won't ever even get to them, I see no reason keeping them in the guide. They were mainly here to promote the work, which I no longer wish to do.
- Removed all of someguy2000's mods from Content
- Removed NVB1 patch from Sweet Perks
