### 08/08/2024

After a moderate hiatus, I am once again updating the guide. A lot of maintenance needed to be done, between mod updates, crash prone mods and new fixes and improvements coming out. The entire guide has received various changes, so these will be listed out in order, rather than type of change as it was in previous changelogs.

### Intro
- Removed leftover denotation guide.
- Fixed the wrong link to TBOT's mod install instructions.
- Moved the Discord section to the bottom.

### Extra Utilities & Fixes
- Updated Stewie's Tweaks with a fix to ammo weight being inverted between non-hardcore and hardcore, as well as a few of the new tweaks.
- Added Gas Trap Performance Fix.
- Updated the install instructions for Consistent Weapon Mod Descriptions.
- Added Flashbang Tutorial Remover.
- Added Slideshow FOV Fix.

### Optimizations
- Removed Mainframes Litter Flickering Fix. A better version is included in MAC-TEN.
- Added Optimized Weapon World Meshes.

### User Interface & HUD
- Added a tip about VUI+ installation, as it's a bit different from the rest of the mods.
- Changed Zelda Style Quick Select aid keybind from 2 to 3. This frees up 2 to be the ammo swap button, which is what most people will be used to.
- Sorted out the ySI mess. Too many mods were clumped together, now they're spread out more logically.
- Removed ySI Sorting - Extended in favor of ySI - Categories Lite from Colorful Icon Support.
- Replaced SPAHUD with Pipboy Holo Panel. Includes custom config that makes it power armor only. SPAHUD was apparently causing crashes.
- Removed JAM from Weapon Hotkey Icons install instructions. The patch is not needed.
- Removed leftover denotations on CPI.
- Separated TTW Goodies into its own thing rather than clumped in with all the CPI mods.
- Updated Pip-Boy UI Tweaks install instructions.
- Removed unnecessary instructions from Instant and Faster Pipboy.

### Gameplay
- Not a guide change, but the default INI for TTW Quick Start Item Remover has been updated for the guide.
- Fixed the name of BDSM. ;)
- Removed MCM instructions for Enhanced Movement. Seems like "Use INI" is enabled by default, so the instructions felt unnecessary. If that's not the case for everyone, let me know.
- Removed all perk mods. The changes were too drastic for most and also came with a performance impact. Also, having to install a mod that changes how the disguise system works for one perk pack was too much. A new perk overhaul has been added to the Overhauls page.

### Combat
- Added a custom INI for Immersive Recoil 2.0 with much more reasonable recoil settings.
- Removed Crippled Limb Reaction Enforcer as it was causing crashes.
- Removed the entire AI section. They were causing far too many problems that were not worth keeping them for.

### Content
- Updated install instructions for A Very Uncreative Collection of TTW Patches.
- Added install instructions for The Great Mojave Interior Overhaul.
- Removed A Trail of Crumbs and The Regulators. They were relatively low quality and didn't add much to the game, plus The Regulators had conflicts with other content mods.
- Removed the unnecessary warnings on Tactapack's update and optional files.
- Added a note about lore friendly names to ZL Armaments.

### Overhauls
- Replaced Famine - TTW Exceptions with Famine Exception Patches.
- Removed New Blood, Aid Addon, Sweet Consumables and Sweet Healing Systems. I felt like they were too overbearing, with too much bloat and unrelated changes, plus some confusion with how the new systems work for newer players.
- Added TTW Perk Overhaul - A PerkSawyer Derivative. Seems to be pretty cool and not very well known.

### Aesthetics & Ambience
- Removed Impostors LOD Flicker Fix. Not really needed anymore unless doing custom LOD setups with greatly increased LOD distances.
- Replaced Blended Locomotion with Enhanced Locomotion.
- Changed Butcher Pete and Wasteland Warrior to use No Locomotion options.
- Updated install instructions for Iron Sights Aligned.
- Added kNVSE Fixpack.
- Added ATMOS - ExRB Patch.
- Added PhySFX.
- Added ATMOS - Atmospheric Lighting Tweaks Patch.
- Added Accurate Stars - Motheship Zeta Patch.

### Final Steps
- Updated load order.
- Fixed the link to the Additions page.
