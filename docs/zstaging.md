## Changelog - Ghost Page

Another SIGNIFICANT reorganization of the overall layout of the guide, as well as many must have (at least, in my opinion) additions! With this update I hope to significantly modernize the options available in the guide, clarify the intent of each section, and appropriately notate when mods are either vanilla plus, not vanilla plus, or hardcore. For those updating from older iterations of the guide, this **IS NOT** save safe. As always, I'm open to feedback and expecting a fair amount of troubleshooting! <3 - Kamchatka

This can be accomplished by installing the mod as instructed, right clicking the mod, clicking information, navigating to the filetree tab, right clicking on the pertinent plugin or folder, and selecting hide. Support **WILL NOT** be provided for those who fail to follow these instructions.

Press F5 to refresh MO2 and if everything went correctly, the list of plugins in the right pane will be reordered. If you installed all of the mods in the guide then the final plugin should be `CC - 3D Rain.esp`, however if you opted to skip some mods then it may be something else. This is fine, as long as you saw the list of plugins being reordered after refreshing.

# Finishing Notes

Congratulations! You now have a modded Tale of Two Wastelands setup to enjoy. For additional resources such as incompatible mods, performance tips, frequently asked questions and more, see the [Appendix](appendix). Join the [TTW Discord](https://discord.gg/taleoftwowastelands) if you have any additional questions about the guide, modding, or just to chill.

# Additional Mods

Check out our [Additions](https://wastelandsurvivalguide.com/docs/additions) page for mods approved and recommended by our team that did not make it into the guide for one reason or another. Unfortunately, we do not have the time or energy to provide support for setups that install extra mods on top of the guide. We cannot stress enough that it is only recommended to add your own mods if you are an experienced modder and know how to manually make conflict resolution patches and sort your load order! If you don't know [how to do that](https://moddinglinked.com/themethod.html) in [xEdit](https://moddinglinked.com/xedit.html), or you are unwilling to spend the time to do so, it is not recommended to add your own mods. You can't just throw a bunch of mods on top of the guide without doing any conflict resolution, or use automated tools like LOOT as a substitute for proper conflict resolution, and expect your game to function as intended. Once again, **we will not support setups that have added any mods**.

# Additions

This section is intended for advanced users who are looking for a more robust modding experience beyond the foundation laid by WSG. <u>Users <b>must</b> be capable of performing their own load order adjustments, patching, and troubleshooting.</u>

:::caution Important!
Do not install this entire section indiscriminately. Pick and choose only the mods that interest you. Otherwise you will end up with a broken game that crashes. The [Basics of xEdit](https://moddinglinked.com/xedit.html) and [The Method](https://moddinglinked.com/themethod.html) can be used to learn the basic principles of patching and conflict resolution.
:::

The WSG team <u>will not</u> provide support for the following mods. Rather, the intent of this section is to provide a list of proven and reliable mods that can be used in conjunction with WSG. In isolation, the majority of these mods will work with the main guide with only minimal patching, though when added in conjunction with one another, they may create a large patching and compatibility burden.
