# Additions

This section is intended for advanced users who are looking for a more robust modding experience beyond the foundation laid by WSG. <u>Users <b>must</b> be capable of performing their own load order adjustments, patching, and troubleshooting.</u>

<u><b>Do not install this entire section indiscriminately. Pick and choose only the mods that interest you. Otherwise you will end up with a broken game that crashes.</b></u> These resources can be used to learn basic patching principles.

The WSG team <u>will not</u> provide support for the following mods. Rather, the intent of this section is to provide a list of proven and reliable mods that can be used in conjunction with WSG. In isolation, the majority of these mods will work with the main guide with only minimal patching, though when added in conjunction with one another, they may create a large patching and compatibility burden.


## Fixes
[Zlib Updated - NVSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/85267) - Updates zlib to the latest version for faster loading and less stutter.

[Lossless Scaling](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/) - Not necessarily a fix per say, but contains fairly robust frame generation capabilities and can functionally double your FPS at the cost of some visual artifact. Would not recommend using the scaling option, ONLY the frame generation. Can be purchased on steam.


## User Interface & HUD
[Alternate Holographic Panel](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/82636) - For use with the mod no pip-boy in power armor, provides an improved holographic control panel interface when activating the pip-boy. This mod is useful for those using STARS.

[Dialogue DoF Disabler](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77220) - Removes the depth of field effect while in the dialogue interface.

[JIP Improved Recipe Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75920) - Improves usability and aesthetics of the recipe menu.

[PipBoy DoF Disabler](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77321) - Removes the depth of field effect while in the pip-boy interface.

[Show Water Source H2O](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/85103) - Water sources will show their hydration amount instead of HP when the player is in hardcore mode.
- Currently incompatible with MUX.

[Sleep, wait, hardcore needs](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/85148) - Shows the amount of H2O, FOD, and SLP that will be gained/lost while sleeping.

[Quick Select - A Zelda BOTW Style Quick Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/82249) - Zelda BOTW/TOTK style weapon and item selection menus.

[ySI Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/84352) - Adds additional ySI sorting subcategories and icons.

[ySI Misc Quest Items Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/81230?tab=files) - Adds additional ySI sorting icons for sheet music, pre-war books, and dog-tags.
